Are you looking for a way to restrict user access to your WordPress site? Look no further! Block Login is the solution you've been searching for. This plugin allows you to block selected user roles from logging into your website, and redirect them to a different page of your choice.

With Block Login, you have complete control over which user roles can log into your website and which cannot. You can choose to block all user roles except for administrator, or select specific roles to block. This means you can restrict access to your site for subscribers, contributors, or any other role you choose.

Once you have selected the user roles to block, simply specify the URL that you would like these users to be redirected to. This can be any page on your website, or an external URL if desired. The plugin will then handle the rest, ensuring that users are redirected as soon as they try to log in.

With Block Login Pro, you can keep your site secure and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

#### Live long, and prosper. May the Force be with you.
